The process of updating an employee must include the following steps:
1. Find the employee and first showcase it in a collapsed view
2. There should be two buttons on the side of the collapsed view of the employee: **Update** and **Delete**
3. If we want to update the employee details, we press update, which brings up an interface similar to that of creating an employee, only here, the text boxes have placeholders, which are the original values of the employee details.
4. If we want to delete the employee, we press the delete button, which pops a warning, asking us we are sure that we want to delete the employee. If we are sure, press delete again.
